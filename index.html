                            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to 'ideas worth spreading'. Originally a 4-day conference on Technology, Entertainment, and Design, it is now a global stage for the worldâ€™s leading thinkers and doers to curate an environment of sharing and ignite curiosity. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            TEDx events are independent, local, and licensed conferences. These local events have become a truly international phenomenon, taking place in more than 130 countries.

                        <p>
                            TEDxUW will take place on November 14th 2015 at the Centre of International Governance and Innovation in Waterloo, Ontario. TEDx conferences typically have a theme in place and our theme for this yearâ€™s conference is Collaboration, in its realest and broadest form.  Our phenomenal speakers will be exploring collaboration within an eclectic range of frameworks (from political and corporate collaboration to collaboration in our daily lives and relationships) and the day is going to be completely reflective of the theme. The schedule for the day is in the works at the moment but will be published on our website closer to the time! 
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h2>How can I attend TEDxUW?</h2>
                        <p>
                            We care about our audience just as much as we care about our speakers; they are two crucial components of our event. In order to attend the event, you will need to take part in an application process. Due to rules in place for independently organized TEDx events, we can only select 100 lucky delegates so you can say that the process is fairly competitive. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            So, what are we looking for in our delegates? People who are passionate about all things TED and ideas worth spreading, individuals who are enthusiastic, driven, eager to meet individuals from various walks of life and eager to learn. The application process consists of one simple application form with a couple of questions that you will need to answer, try to be yourself and be honest in your application. Each application will be reviewed carefully and scored independently by our Attendee Relations team. More information on the application process timeline and the form itself will be found on our website and social media channels closer to the time.

                        <p>
                            At TEDxUW, we really care about the speakers you have in mind! With that said, every year, we have a Speaker Nomination Process in place whereby you can nominate either yourself, somebody you know or somebody you think would make a great TEDx speaker. The deadline for this yearâ€™s Speaker Nomination Process has now passed, however, if you still have any burning requests and you feel like you just have to let us know, please send us an e-mail at  and our Speaker Relations team will take your request into consideration (except in the case that weâ€™ve already reached our maximum speaker capacity).
